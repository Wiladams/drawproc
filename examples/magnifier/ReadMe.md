This magnifier project demonstrates one way in which image 
magnification can occur.  It's fairly crude in that it just takes
a pixel value, and replicates it multiple times horizontally and
vertically.  No filtering occurs, so the expansion looks very blocky.
This is a good 'pixelate' effect.

In order to make it work, the file 'moon-wide.ppm', which can be found
in the 'examples/media' directory, should be copied to the Release or Debug 
directory, so it can be found.
